                    >*</sup
                >
            </li>
        </ul>
        <sup>*</sup>If prepping for the week, omitting these is recommended to
        allow seasoning the neutral meat for different cuisines later.

        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A braising vessel like a dutch oven or pot with a lid, large
                enough to completely submerge your meat.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Salt the meat & preheat the oven:</strong> Generously
                cover all sides of your braising meat with salt. Preheat oven to
                275 degrees F.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Sear the meat:</strong> Over high heat, add oil to your
                braising vessel and lay in your meat to sear, in batches if
                necessary. Sear it on all sides to develop some nice browning.
                If using aromatics, this is where you would brown them.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Add the braising liquid and put into the oven:</strong>
                Add enough braising liquid to cover your meat. Water or broth
                will work. Bring that liquid to a boil and then pop it into a
                preheated 275 degrees F oven for 3 to 7 hours, depending on your
                cut of meat (the exception here is chicken. Check it after an
                hour).
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong
                    >Shred and set away for meals throughout the week:</strong
                >
                Your braise is done when the meat shreds apart easily. Separate
                that out into containers and save the broth to use as well.
