        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large pot over medium heat, wam the olive oil. Add the
                linguiça and coot until lightly browned on both sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rmove the sausage slices with a slotted spoon and transfer them
                to a plate, making sure they drain well into the pot; the fat
                will flavor the soup.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dump the spanish onion into the pot. Sprinkle with kosher salt
                and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent.

            </li>
            <li>
                Add the potatoes, water, and broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce the
                heat to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are almost tender.
                Remove from the heat and let soup cool slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Puree the soup, optionally adding half the linguiça prior to
                blending.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the collard greens and bring the soup back to a boil. Reduce
                heat and simmer until tender. Season with salt, and freshly
                ground pepper.

            <li>
                Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the remaining slices
                of linguiça.
            </li>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Storage:</strong> Store leftover caldo verde in a sealed
                container in the fridge for up to 4 days.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Freezing:</strong> To freeze the soup, let it cool
                fully, then portion it into containers or resealable bags and
                store it in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge
                before reheating.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reheating and thinning:</strong> Reheat in a saucepan
                over medium-low heat until warmed through. If the soup is too
                thick after reheating, thin with additional broth or water.
            </li>
        </ul>
